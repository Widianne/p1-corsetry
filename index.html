            I'm Ava, a Paris-based corset maker with a BA in Fashion Design from
            the London College of Contemporary Arts. I've been passionately
            crafting corsets for a decade, specializing in styles from the 16th
            to the 20th century since the inception of my independent fashion
            brand. Why make corsets, you might ask? Well, as a self-proclaimed
            fashion history nerd, I can't help but be baffled by the
            misinformation surrounding these intricate garments. I am here to
            change that!

            Corsets are designed to shape and support the torso and they have
            been worn for centuries. Corsets first emerged in the 16th century,
            evolving from stiffened bodices into more structured undergarments.
            They reached the height of popularity in the 19th century. Corsets
            have played various roles throughout history, from shaping fashion
            trends to offering the wearer needed support. While they faced
            criticism for health concerns, well-constructed corsets were
            designed for comfort and function.

            The enduring myths about corsets from the past continue to shape
            public perception today, despite the fact that corsets remain a part
            of modern fashion and culture. These persistent misconceptions
            include the belief that corsets are hazardous to health and highly
            uncomfortable. There's also the common misconception that only women
            wear corsets and that they serve solely as restrictive fashion
            pieces, leading to bedridden states and vanity.

              In reality, corsets are still worn by many, including celebrities
              who showcase them on the red carpet. Some individuals wear corsets
              for medical reasons, as they can provide valuable support.
              Moreover, those engaged in historical re-enactments find corsets
              essential for capturing the authentic styles of the past, an act
              that can be both for plesure and politics.
