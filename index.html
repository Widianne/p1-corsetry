                <h2>Welcome</h2>
                <p>I'm Ava, a Paris-based corset maker with a BA in Fashion Design 
                    from the London College of Contemporary Arts. I've been passionately 
                    crafting corsets for a decade, specializing in styles from 
                    the 16th to the 20th century since the inception of my independent 
                    fashion brand. Why make corsets, you might ask? Well, as a 
                    self-proclaimed fashion history nerd, I can't help but be baffled by 
                    the misinformation surrounding these intricate garments. I am here to 
                    change that!</p>

                <h2>Corset History</h2>
                <img src="assets/imgs/corset.jpg" id="corset-img" alt="Woman wearing a corseted dress">
                <p>Corsets are designed to shape and support the torso and they have been worn for centuries. 
                    Corsets first emerged in the 16th century, evolving from stiffened bodices into more 
                    structured undergarments. They reached the height of popularity in the 19th 
                    century. Corsets have played various roles throughout history, from shaping fashion 
                    trends to offering the wearer needed support. While they faced criticism for health concerns,
                    well-constructed corsets were designed for comfort and function.</p>
                    
                   <img src="assets/imgs/machine.jpg" id="machine-img" alt="Old sewing machine">

                <p>The enduring myths about corsets from the past continue to shape public perception today, 
                   despite the fact that corsets remain a part of modern fashion and culture. These persistent 
                   misconceptions include the belief that corsets are hazardous to health and highly uncomfortable. 
                   There's also the common misconception that only women wear corsets and that they serve solely 
                   as restrictive fashion pieces, leading to bedridden states and vanity. In reality, corsets are 
                   still worn by many, including celebrities who showcase them on the red carpet. Some individuals 
                   wear corsets for medical reasons, as they can provide valuable support. Moreover, those engaged 
                   in historical re-enactments find corsets essential for capturing the authentic styles of the past, 
                   an act that can be both for plesure and politics.
